FROM THE RED FOX TO THE FENNEC FOX, FOXES LOOK ADORABLE. BECAUSE OF THIS, PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES TEMPTED TO KEEP THEM AS PETS. HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED HAVE STRUGGLED. UNLIKE DOGS AND CATS, THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FOX HAVE NOT BEEN DOMESTICATED. DOMESTICATION ONLY HAPPENS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THROUGH SELECTIVE BREEDING. CATS AND DOGS WERE DOMESTICATED BY HUMANS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO TO BE PETS AND COMPANIONS. SHEEP, GOATS AND OTHER ANIMALS WERE DOMESTICATED FOR FOOD. BUT THERE MAY BE MORE TO IT THAN THAT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO SIMPLY TAME INDIVIDUAL FOXES OFTEN SPEAK OF A STUBBORN WILDNESS THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF. THIS SUGGESTS THAT FOXES HARDER TO TAME THAN OTHER ANIMALS. HOWEVER, ONE EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIMENT HAS FOUND A WAY TO DOMESTICATE FOXES. THIS ONE STUDY COULD HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW OUR ANCESTORS DOMESTICATED OTHER ANIMALS, AND INDEED WHAT DOMESTICATION IS.
