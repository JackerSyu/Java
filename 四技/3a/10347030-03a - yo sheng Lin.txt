=======================================================================================
(1)程式沒有明顯問題.
(2)程式執行結果有誤.
*(3)程式需要自行測試, 請注意以下的問題.
   *(3-1)程式格式有誤: 沒有階層式內縮, 內縮距離不足, 內縮距離不一致, 或無意義的空行.
=> 多注意避免無意義的空行.
   (3-2)不容易閱讀: 具有特定意義的程式段落缺少分隔或註解, 或是同一行中擠進太多內容.                     
   (3-3)變數命名不適合: 未給予具有特別意義的變數符合其意義的名稱.
   (3-4)誤用常數: 程式中重覆出現特定數值, 或使用的常數與其他變數過度相依.
   (3-5)過於複雜的設計: 很明顯有更簡單的設計方式可以取代現有設計.
   (3-6)重覆或過於相似的程式段落: 程式中存在多個相同或相似段落, 明顯可整合但未整合.
   (3-7)沒有意義的指令: 存在不影響程式執行結果, 但又會被執行的程式敘述.
   (3-8)程式撰寫其他建議.
